# Whatsapp_chat_analyzer_PG_project
During PGDAI course from CDAC Noida. We have worked on this project which comes out to be successful.
WhatsApp-Analyzer is a statistical analysis tool for WhatsApp chats. Working on the chat files that can be
exported from WhatsApp it generates various plots showing, for example, which other participant a user
responds to the most. Communication between people using the internet becomes part of their daily life.
People used to communicate with each other using the online chat system to transfer their messages.We
propose to employ dataset manipulation techniques to have a better understanding of WhatsApp chat present
in our phones.It shows most used emoji and words which are repeated most times and also sentiment
between the chats. It tracks our conversation and analyzes how much time we are spending.
